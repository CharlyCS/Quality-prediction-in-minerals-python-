# Quality-prediction-in-minerals-python-SVR
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict the quality of minerals. By applying Support Vector Regression algorithm, the goal is to accurately predict the quality of minerals based on relevant features. This readme provides a comprehensive guide to understand and reproduce the project.
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/mineral-quality-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd mineral-quality-prediction
Usage
1.-Have the required dataset (See https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/nishp763/Quality_Prediction_ML/master/dataset.csv)
2.-Run the preprocessing scripts to clean and transform the data(See (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mkoerner1/iron-mining-production-prediction) this code that i took as base to model it).
3.-Train the machine learning models.
4.-Evaluate the trained models.
5.-Generate predictions using the trained models.
6.-Interpret and analyze the results.
